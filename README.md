mark_one_game_engine

In my 3rd year at University I was given a sample game engine, which my lecturer had written himself using the Java language, and told to create a platformer game.  I got a reasonable grade for the assignment, and quite enjoyed working on the project.  I decided to try and replicate the engine in Rust, and to make a few small improvements along the way.  This project is done mainly as a learning activity, and is unlikely to end up with a particularly high-performance game engine.  If I ever get it finished then hopefully I'll be able to put together a few simple games to showcase it though.

The aim is to create an entirely Rust-based 2D game engine, which does not use any specific game-oriented libraries or plugins.  Support for saved files, tilemaps, sounds, and a few common image file formats will all be added at some point.  I'm a big fan of "Clean Code" by Robert C Martin, so I'm hoping to make this project a bit of a showcase for clean code principles, and for test-driven development.  

While I might add a simple 2D physics engine to the project, this engine is probably not going to be able to handle much beyond games in the style of classic top-down isometric RPGs like Diablo, or "4X" turn-based games like Civilisation and Master of Orion.
